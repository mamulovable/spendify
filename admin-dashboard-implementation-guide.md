# Admin Dashboard Implementation Guide

We've created a comprehensive spec and database schema for the Spendify admin dashboard. This guide will help you understand what has been created and how to implement it.

## Spec Documents

1. **Requirements Document**: `.kiro/specs/admin-dashboard/requirements.md`
   - Detailed requirements for all 8 sections of the admin dashboard
   - User stories and acceptance criteria for each feature

2. **Design Document**: `.kiro/specs/admin-dashboard/design.md`
   - Architecture overview
   - Component designs with code examples
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Data models
   - Error handling strategies
   - Testing strategies

3. **Implementation Plan**: `.kiro/specs/admin-dashboard/tasks.md`
   - Detailed task breakdown for implementing the admin dashboard
   - Tasks organized by feature area
   - References to requirements for each task

## Database Schema Files

We've created SQL files for each major section of the admin dashboard:

1. **Admin Users & Permissions**: `supabase/admin_users_permissions.sql`
   - Admin roles and permissions system
   - Admin authentication
   - Role-based access control

2. **Audit Logging**: `supabase/audit_logs_schema.sql`
   - Comprehensive audit logging system
   - Admin action tracking
   - Security monitoring

3. **User Management**: `supabase/user_management_schema.sql`
   - User activity tracking
   - User metrics and analytics
   - User management functions (suspend, delete, upgrade)

4. **Analytics & Revenue**: `supabase/analytics_revenue_schema.sql`
   - Revenue tracking
   - AppSumo code redemption tracking
   - Financial metrics and reporting

5. **Document Processing**: `supabase/document_processing_schema.sql`
   - Document processing queue
   - AI model version tracking
   - Processing results and metrics

6. **Support & AI Feedback**: `supabase/support_ai_feedback_schema.sql`
   - Support ticket system
   - AI feedback collection and review
   - Training data management

7. **Feature Flags & Configuration**: `supabase/feature_flags_config_schema.sql`
   - Feature flag management
   - Application configuration
   - Announcement system

## Implementation Steps

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Run each SQL file in the Supabase SQL editor
   - Verify tables, functions, and views are created correctly

2. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - Follow the implementation plan in the tasks document
   - Use the component designs from the design document
   - Implement each section of the admin dashboard

3. **Testing**:
   - Test each feature against the acceptance criteria
   - Verify security and permissions
   - Test with realistic data volumes

## Next Steps

1. Start by implementing the admin authentication system
2. Create the admin dashboard layout and navigation
3. Implement each section following the task list
4. Test thoroughly before deployment

## Notes

- The database schema includes comprehensive functions for all admin operations
- Row-level security is implemented for all tables
- Audit logging is automatically triggered for sensitive operations
- The schema includes views for common admin queries
- Metrics tables are included for performance optimization
